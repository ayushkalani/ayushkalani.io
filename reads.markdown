# Reading Recommendations

Welcome to my curated collection of interesting newsletters and articles! Here, I share thought-provoking reads that have expanded my perspectives, taught me something new, or simply provided enjoyable content. I update this page regularly as I discover new gems.

## Featured Newsletters

These are the newsletters that consistently deliver valuable insights to my inbox. I look forward to each new issue!

### 💡 [Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/)
**Why I subscribe:** Ben's analysis of tech business strategy is unparalleled. He has a unique ability to connect dots between business models, technology evolution, and market dynamics that few others can match. His frameworks like Aggregation Theory have fundamentally changed how I understand tech businesses.

**What's special:** Unlike typical tech analysis that focuses on products or features, Ben dives deep into the structural advantages and strategic positions of companies. His consistent publishing schedule (four posts weekly) and independent perspective make this worth every penny of the subscription.

### 🏙️ [Dror Poleg's Newsletter](https://www.drorpoleg.com/)
**Why I subscribe:** Dror offers fascinating insights at the intersection of real estate, technology, and the future of work. His perspective as someone who understands both physical space and digital transformation gives him a unique lens on how our cities and workplaces are evolving.

**What's special:** Dror challenges conventional thinking about work, cities, and property. His newsletter is particularly valuable for understanding larger economic shifts driven by remote work, digital platforms, and changing urban dynamics. I often find myself thinking about his ideas for days after reading.

### 🚀 [Ankur Warikoo's Newsletter](https://ankurwarikoo.com/newsletter/)
**Why I subscribe:** Ankur combines practical business wisdom with personal development insights in a way that's accessible and actionable. His background as an entrepreneur and educator gives him a pragmatic perspective that cuts through the typical self-help noise.

**What's special:** What I appreciate most is how Ankur distills complex concepts into simple frameworks. He shares both successes and failures openly, making his advice feel authentic and tested. His content on decision-making and personal productivity has directly improved my daily habits.

### 📚 [Brain Food by Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/newsletter/)
**Why I subscribe:** Every Sunday, this newsletter delivers thought-provoking ideas about mental models, decision-making, and wisdom that stands the test of time. The curation is excellent and I always walk away with something to think about.

  A thoughtful exploration of how considering the long-term consequences of technical decisions can lead to more maintainable and scalable software.

### Science & Philosophy

  How our certainty about what we know often exceeds our actual knowledge, and what we can do about this cognitive bias.

## Long-form Content Worth Your Time

Some pieces require more time investment but deliver proportionally deeper value:

## My Reading Notes

Sometimes I take detailed notes on particularly impactful reads. Here are some excerpts:

### On "Thinking in Systems" by Donella Meadows

> The book introduced me to the concept of "leverage points" - places in complex systems where small changes can lead to big shifts. What struck me most was how counterintuitive these points often are; the obvious intervention is rarely the most effective one.

### On "Deep Work" by Cal Newport

> Newport's distinction between "deep work" and "shallow work" transformed how I structure my day. I've since implemented dedicated blocks of distraction-free time, which has dramatically improved both my productivity and satisfaction.
