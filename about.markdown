I’m Ayush Kalani colloquiallly know as Kalani 👨🏻‍💻 — software builder and full-time curious human 🚀. Born in Jaipur, currently adulting in San Francisco. I wrangle AI/ML stuff for a living and collect vinyl records like it's still 1975. Big fan of deep conversations, spicy food, rock and roll music 🎸, and quiet mornings. This blog is my digital playground —expect tech rants, life musings, and maybe a few hot takes no one asked for 😎. Welcome to the chaos, stay for the vibes ✨
