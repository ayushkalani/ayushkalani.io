I’m Ayush Kalani colloquiallly know as Kalani 👨🏻‍💻 — software builder and full-time curious human 🚀. Born in Jaipur 🐪, currently adulting in San Francisco 🌁. I wrangle AI/ML stuff for a living 🤖 and collect vinyl records like it's still 1975 🎶. Big fan of deep conversations, spicy food 🌶️, rock and roll music 🎸, and quiet mornings ☕. This blog is my digital playground 🛝—expect tech rants, life musings, and maybe a few hot takes no one asked for 😎. Welcome to the chaos, stay for the vibes ✨
