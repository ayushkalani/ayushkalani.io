# Who am I ?
Ayush Kalani colloquially known as _Kalani_ is a software builder and full-time curious human. Born and raised in Jaipur, he's now working in San Francisco, where he wrangles Machine Learning and Distriubuted systems for a living ðŸ¤– and collects vinyl records like itâ€™s still 1975 ðŸŽ¶. A fan of deep conversations, art, rock and roll music. Kalani lives for the little joys. This blog is his digital playground â€” a space for tech rants, life musings, and the occasional hot take no one asked for. Welcome to the chaosâ€”stay for the vibes âœ¨
