# Wisdom Collection

> EVERY SINGLE DAY, we are lying to ourselves. We may not lie as often to others, but we are ALWAYS lying to ourselves. We are trying to convince ourselves that whatever we are feeling is temporary, is transient, is foolish, is immaterial, is unnecessary. We are lying to ourselves that our sorry state of affairs is going to magically lead us to some happy state.

> And that was true for the girl too. She is lying to herself that this relationship is what she needs. That he loves her. That she loves him despite his lack of respect towards her. The truth is - she is most certainly just scared of being alone. She is scared of the options outside of her current state. And so, she will lie to herself that her current state offers her "at least something"

> And something is better than nothing!

2. They took their time to answer. For them speed didn't mean smartness.
3. They smiled often.
